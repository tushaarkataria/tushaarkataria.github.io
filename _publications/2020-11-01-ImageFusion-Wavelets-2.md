excerpt: 'In the field of multi-data analysis and fusion, image fusion plays a vital role for many applications. With inventions of new sensors, the demand of high quality image fusion algorithms has seen tremendous growth. Wavelet based fusion is a popular choice for many image fusion algorithms, because of its ability to decouple different features of information. However, it suffers from ringing artifacts generated in the output. This paper presents an analysis of ringing artifacts in application of image fusion using directional wavelets (curvelets, contourlets, non-subsampled contourlets etc.). We compare the performance of various fusion rules for directional wavelets available in literature. The experimental results suggest that the ringing artifacts are present in all types of wavelets with the extent of artifact varying with type of the wavelet, fusion rule used and levels of decomposition.'
