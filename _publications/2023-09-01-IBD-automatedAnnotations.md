excerpt: 'The microscopic evaluation of glands in the colon is of utmost importance in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. When properly trained, deep learning pipelines can provide a systematic, reproducible, and quantitative assessment of disease-related changes in glandular tissue architecture. The training and testing of deep learning models require large amounts of manual annotations, which are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to obtain. Here, we propose a method for the automated generation of ground truth in digital hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides using immunohistochemistry (IHC) labels. The image processing pipeline generates annotations of glands in H&E histopathology images from colon biopsies by transfer of gland masks from CK8/18, CDX2, or EpCAM IHC. The IHC gland outlines are transferred to co-registered H&E images for the training of deep learning models. We compare the performance of the deep learning models to manual annotations using an internal held out set of biopsies as well as two public datasets. Our results show that EpCAM IHC provides gland outlines that closely match manual gland annotations (Dice = 0.89) and are robust to damage by inflammation. In addition, we propose a simple data sampling technique that allows models trained on data from several sources to be adapted to a new data source using just a few newly annotated samples. The best performing models achieved average Dice scores of 0.902 and 0.89, respectively, on GLAS and CRAG colon cancer public datasets when trained with only 10% of annotated cases from either public cohort. Altogether, the performances of our models indicate that automated annotations using cell type specific IHC markers can safely replace manual annotations. Automated IHC labels from single institution cohorts can be combined with small numbers of hand-annotated cases from multi-institutional cohorts to train models that generalize well to diverse data sources.'
