excerpt: 'A thorough analysis of the ringing phenomenon, by experimenting with different types of images and different wavelet families, with varying lengths of filters and varying levels of decomposition is performed to obtain deeper insights of the ringing artifacts. It is experimentally shown that wavelet based fusion results in the modification of the intra- and inter-scale dependencies, with the inter-scale dependency being the dominating factor causing the ringing artifacts. Also, these ringing artifacts are localized in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, a quantitative measure using structural dissimilarity is proposed to measure the ringing artifacts due to wavelet based fusion. Two possible solutions to compensate for the ringing artifacts are then proposed. In the first strategy, a filtering based method is proposed to reduce these ringing artifacts. It takes advantage of the localized nature of the ringing artifacts. Furthermore, the intra- and inter-scale dependencies are modeled using order-zero entropy. A second strategy using the inter-scale dependency is then proposed to reduce the ringing artifacts. Experimental results show that both these methods are able to reduce the ringing artifacts significantly and have further scope for improvement. Another critical finding of this work is selection of the wavelet filter and its levels of decomposition for the process of fusion.'
